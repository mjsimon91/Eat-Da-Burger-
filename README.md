# Its time to Eat-Da-Burger!

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.  Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Have fun buiding a "full stack" burger, devouring it, and watching it move into the belly of the site.
